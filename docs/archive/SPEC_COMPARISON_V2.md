**Current Implementation**: Fixed port configuration
**Impact**: Missing automatic port allocation system

### 3. **Binary Distribution**
**Your SPEC**: 9 platform-specific binaries with ARM6/7 support
**Current Implementation**: Basic cross-platform build
**Impact**: Missing ARM6/7 and x86 builds

## Critical Missing Components

### 1. **First User Flow with Admin Account**
**Your SPEC Requirements:**
- First user registration triggers admin account creation
- Separate administrator account with generated/custom password
- Auto-login as admin after creation
- Launch setup wizard while logged in as admin

**Current Implementation:**
- Basic first user detection
- No separate admin account creation flow
- No auto-login mechanism
- Setup wizard exists but not integrated with first user flow

### 2. **Enhanced Health Check Endpoint**

3. **Search Index Metadata** (`search_index_metadata` table)
4. **Data Retention Policies** (`data_retention_policies` table)
5. **Import Jobs Tracking** (`import_jobs`, `import_items` tables)

## Conclusion

The current implementation provides a solid foundation with approximately **70% feature compliance** but requires significant work to match the comprehensive specification, particularly in:

2. Enhanced UI/UX components
3. PWA and mobile features
4. Dynamic documentation system
5. Advanced monitoring and health checks

The architectural differences (CLI approach, port management) represent fundamental design decisions that would require careful consideration before implementation.
