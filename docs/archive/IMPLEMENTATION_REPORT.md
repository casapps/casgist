3. **Services**
   - `retry.go`: Webhook delivery with exponential backoff
   - `health_enhanced.go`: Comprehensive health monitoring
   - `setup.go`: First-user admin creation flow

### API Endpoints Verified
- `/health` - Basic health check ‚úÖ
- `/api/v1/health` - Enhanced health with metrics ‚úÖ
- `/setup/status` - Setup wizard status ‚úÖ
- `/setup/admin` - First admin creation ‚úÖ
- `/cli.sh` - Dynamic CLI generation ‚úÖ

## üöÄ Deployment Verification

### Docker Testing Results
```bash
# Build successful
docker build -t casgists:final .

# Container running with auto-selected port
docker logs casgists
> CasGists vdev starting on port 64772

# Health check passing
docker exec casgists curl http://localhost:64772/health
> {"database":"ok","status":"healthy","uptime":"0h 5m"}

# Setup wizard ready
docker exec casgists curl http://localhost:64772/setup/status
> {"completed":false,"initialized":false,"step":"admin"}
```

### Environment-Only Configuration
```bash
# Works without config file
CASGISTS_DATABASE_TYPE=sqlite \
CASGISTS_DATABASE_DSN=/data/test.db \
CASGISTS_SERVER_PORT=0 \
./casgists

# Auto-selects port from range
> Starting on port 64570
```
